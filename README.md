# sql

I had a need to simulate a realtime application on MicroStrategy, for that reason I created a table and a stored procedure to insert data into a table every few seconds, instead of build the entire realtime ecosystem. 

Use the store procedure file to get the information on how I build the table and the actual stored procedure.
